# 🏛️ BailBridge: A Bail Reckoner System

**BailBridge** is an innovative digital solution designed for the Ministry of Law and Justice under the *Smart India Hackathon (SIH)* initiative.  
Its aim is to assist **undertrial prisoners**, **legal aid providers**, and **judicial authorities** in streamlining and expediting the bail process using technology.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The current bail process in India is often **time-consuming**, **manual**, and **lacks a centralized system** to check eligibility based on multiple legal parameters.  
As a result, many undertrial prisoners remain in custody longer than necessary due to procedural delays and lack of legal awareness.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a **user-friendly**, **plug-and-play** tool that:
- Maps legal charges with corresponding laws & punishments.
- Calculates bail eligibility based on imprisonment served.
- Assesses potential risks like absconding or evidence tampering.
- Provides procedural compliance checklists.
- References relevant judicial precedents for fair decision-making.
